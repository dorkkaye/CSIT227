Write a class that would match a string. The class has method  match with String as a return type.  It accepts two inputs: the phrase/sentence string (text) and the pattern string (word). This method finds the first (or all) instances of the pattern in the text and changes that word in all uppercase and return the new phrase. Method countOccurence accepts a phrase/sentence and a pattern string and returns its number of occurrences.

Add a main method that will allow the user to input the phrase/sentence and pattern. Call method match and countOccurence. See test case below.

Sample Input: 
Text string: You will always have my love, my love, for the love I love is as lovely as love itself. 
Pattern string: love 

Output: 
New text: You will always have my LOVE, my LOVE, for the LOVE I LOVE is as lovely as LOVE itself. 
Number of occurrence: 5
