A company selling household appliances gives commissions to its salesman determined by the kind of product sold as well as the sales amount.  

Type 1: 7% of sale or 400, whichever is more.  
Type 2: 10% of sale or 900, whichever is less.  
Type 3: 12% of sale.  
Type 4: P250, regardless of sale price.  

Make a program that would input the TYPE of appliance sold (between 1-4) and the sale PRICE (a positive floating-point value), and output the COMMission that the salesman will receive.
