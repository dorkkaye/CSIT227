Use a single-subscripted array to solve the following problem. A company pays its salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople receive Php200 per week plus 9 percent of their gross sales for the week. For example, a salesperson who grosses Php3000 in sales in a week receives Php200 plus 9 percent of Php3000, or a total of Php470. Write a C program that determines how many of the 10 salespeople earned salaries which is more than Php500.
