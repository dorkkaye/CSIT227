Problem (Circle.java)

1. Implement a class called Circle for representing a circle. The circle has two data members, a Point object representing the center of the circle and a float value representing the radius.
2. Include appropriate constructors for your Circle class.
3. Encapsulate it.
4. Also include methods for finding the area and circumference of the circle.
    area = pi * radius * radius
    circumference = 2 * pi * radius.
        (You may use the static constant pi in the Math class)
5. Override the toString() and equals().
