Take as input the student’s grades of seven subjects and its corresponding unit taken in a semester. A student is considered failed if the average grade is less than 3.0. Compute the student’s General Point Average (GPA) by multiplying the grade per subject by its corresponding unit, sum up the products and divide the sum by its total units. Print the computed average grade and whether the student “failed” or “passed”.
