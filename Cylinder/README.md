Problem (Cylinder.java)

a. Implement a class called Cylinder. A cylinder has a circle and one additional data member for representing the height (type float).

b. Create appropriate constructors for your Cylinder class.

c. Encapsulate it.

d. Include methods for finding the volume and area of your Cylinder.

area = 2 * (area of the circle in this cylinder) + 2 * pi * radius + height

volume = (area of the circle in this cylinder) * height

e. Override the toString method of the Object class. Try to use the toString of the Circle class and then just concatenate the remaining values.

f. Override the equals method of the Object class. Two Cylinder objects are equal if they have the same center and the same radius and the same height.
